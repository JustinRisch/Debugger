Debugger
======== 
By: Justin Risch, Amber Elliott, and Matthew Shifflet! 
Debugger is a game of catching bugs! Not like try{}catch(){} but with a net. 

In the world of Tron, you will run through the rooms searching for 4 butterflies, 
two centipedes, and a spider. 

Controls:
Run forward by pressing W or the Up arrow.
Run backwards by pressing S or the Down arrow.
Turn by either using the Mouse, or by pressing A or D, or the Left and Right arrow keys. 
Press shift to pause the game. 

Gameplay: 
To "catch" a bug, you need only stand very close to them and hit space. You will hit them
with the net (even if the net "misses" graphically), and deal 20 damage. This increased hit 
box size was deliberate, as limiting the hit box to where the net actually swings made the 
game incredibly difficult, almost impossible, or the net so large that it looked... weird. 
Thus, so long as the bug is within a few units of you, it will hit.

Hitting a spider will make it lose legs, and slow down a little. 
Hitting a centipede will make it lose a body segment, getting shorter. 
Hitting a butterfly will make it's body disappear, and it's wings will flutter to the floor. 

The objective is to catch them all as quickly as possible. On completion, the game will
pause and display the words "Victory Time" under the minimap. 

Good Luck!
